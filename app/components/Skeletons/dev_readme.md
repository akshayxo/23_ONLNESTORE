## Usage for FormSkeleton.tsx

tbh this file useless because I use SSR to load data from DB
It may be helpful when user click '>' in pagination bar to go to the next page
In case user have slow internet this skeleton will be shown

## Usage for InitialPageLoadingSkeleton.tsx

This skeleton uses for initial page loading
Issues:

1. UI doesn't match actiall UI (I mean position is not pixel perfect for all devices)
